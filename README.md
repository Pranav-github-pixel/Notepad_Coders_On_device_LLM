# Samsung EnnovateX 2025 AI Challenge Submission

- **Problem Statement** - *(On-Device Fine-Tuning Framework for Billion+ Parameter scale LLMs
Efficient framework for the on-device fine-tuning of Billion+ scale Large Language Models on a Galaxy S23-S25 equivalent smartphone/edge device. Enable a typical application to adapt a pre-trained LLM to a user's personal data, all while operating within the tight constraints of a mobileÂ environment.)*
